.Sh DESCRIPTION          \" Section Header - required - don't modify
.Nm
opens standard input through the
.Xr open 1
command.
If an output
.Ar file
is not specified, one is created in the temporary dictory.
If it does not have an extension, the output file is renamed with the proper
file extension in order to be opened in the appropriate application
by the
.Xr open 1
command. If it has an extension, that extension overrides that behavior.
.Pp
File extensions are chosen by picking the first listed extension for the
appropriate MIME type in a MIME type to file extensions mapping file.
If no such file is
available,
.Nm
maps
.Cm text/html
to
.Cm html
and
.Cm text/plain
to
.Cm txt .
.Pp
If no
.Ar mime-type
is given,
.Nm
determines the standard input contents' MIME type using
.Xr file 1 .
.Pp
The following options are available (options cannot be combined in a single argument):
.Bl -tag -width -indent  \" Differs from above in tag removed 
.It Fl h               \"-a flag as a list item
Prints a help usage message documenting each option.
.It Fl Fl mime-types Ar file               \"-a flag as a list item
Use
.Ar file
to determine which file extension to use for a given MIME type.
.Ar file
must be in the format of Apache or CUPS
.Cm mime.types
files.
.It Fl k Ar [ seconds ]
Keep the temporary file for the given number of
.Ar seconds .
If
.Ar seconds
is not given, the temporary file is not deleted.
.It Fl o Ar file | Ar mime-type | Ar ext
If
.Ar file
is given, copy standard output to it. If a file extension is present,
acts as if
.Ar ext
has been given.
If
.Ar file
is
.Cm -
then output will go to a temporary file as well as to standard output.
Giving either
.Ar mime-type
or
.Ar ext
forces the MIME type or file extension, bypassing any automatic
detection of either.
.It Fl Fl Ar arg ...
Passes
.Ar arg
and any subsequent argument to the command used to open the file.
